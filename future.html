    <h1 class="title">Future Plans</h1>
    <p>My goal is to become a skilled software developer who can contribute to real-world projects and innovative startups. I plan to work in tech companies where I can continue learning and growing, especially in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and web design.

At the same time, I aspire to become a professional player in the esports scene. Gaming has always been a passion of mine, and I want to take it to the next level by competing and representing in professional tournaments.

Eventually, I hope to use my combined skills in software development, web design, and gaming to create tech solutions that can benefit my local community and inspire others to pursue their dreams in both technology and esports.</p>
