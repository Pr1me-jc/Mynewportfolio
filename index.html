      <p class="section__text__p1">Hello, I'm John Carlo Gabia</p>
      <p class="section__text__p2">3rd year Student of CvSU-Bacoor</p>
         <h1 class="title">Hobbies</h1>
         <p class="section__text__p1">"In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of activities that help me relax and express myself. One of my favorite hobbies is playing online games, which not only entertains me but also sharpens my strategic thinking and decision-making skills. I also love reading manga because it immerses me in different stories and artistic styles, fueling my imagination. Watching anime and movies is another way I unwind, as it allows me to explore diverse cultures, genres, and emotions through visual storytelling. I'm also passionate about music; I listen to different genres depending on my mood, and it helps me focus, relax, or feel inspired. Lastly, I value rest, so I often take time to sleep and recharge—it's my way of caring for my mental and physical well-being."</p>
         <h1 class="title">Family Background</h1>
               <p class="section__text__p1">"We are a family of six, consisting of my parents and us four siblings. My mother is originally from the province of Marinduque, known for its rich culture and traditions, while my father hails from Batangas, a place famous for its strong heritage and hospitality. Among us siblings, one has already completed their education and is now working toward building their future. As for the remaining three of us, we are still pursuing our studies, each with our own goals and aspirations. Despite our different paths, we support each other and share a strong bond as a family."</p>
